Navs
----

Everything with navigation has a class now in bootstrap 4. You can ditch the ul>li>a structure if order does not matter to you and use a new nav element

Display : flex or d-flex is enabled by default so you can add classes that move things around without having to apply display : flex to it. 

Grid System from bootstrap 4
----------------------------

New breakpoints for screen size. xs in bootstrap 4 is less than 576px as opposed to 768px in 3.

Xtra small is the default size and everything is applied from that upward. Any changes to layout need to be applied to the sm size upward.

col is still used albeit with the new screen size definistions. Setting the class to "col" will make your elements split all the available space evenly.
