Bootstrap
---------

Bootstrap is a tool for developing responsive mobile first web projects. I.E. Make great looking sites quickly.

Bootstrap, if used well, makes it hard to tell that someone was using bootstrap. 

Bootstrap comes with preset styles in the included css files, but the styles can be overwritten by writing your own styles targeting the classes bootstrap comes with.

Jumbotron - used to display key content on your site. Takes up large amounts of space. Jumbotron will take up 100% width of whatever it is contained in unless styled otherwise. (div class="container")

Forms - take various types of information. Can be styled in a billion different ways. Important classes are form-group, form-inline, and form-control. Form-group provides proper spacing of the various form elements. Form-control essentially "bootstrapifies" the various elements inside the form. Wrapping a form inside a tag with form-inline will be forced in-line. 

Containers - a nice way to quickly get quality spacing of elements on the page.

Navbars - default styling for navigation bar elements. Requires jquery and bootstrap js in order for anything to actually work. Important class is (class="collapse navbar-collapse"). Anything inside the navbar with that class applied either directly or inherited will collapse automatically once mobile size has been reached on screen.
The hamburger button is applied with 3 spans being styled into bars inside of a button. The key thing about the button is the data-target selector. Whatever id is in the data-target selector will be hidden and shown upon clicking the button. The # is not needed on subsequent ids, you need only match the exact spelling and syntax.


Grid System - The main reason people use bootstrap. Allows for easy layouts of the entire site that is mobile friendly. 12 is the key # here, every container can be divided into 12 units, and they can be nested within each other to further divide those units.
