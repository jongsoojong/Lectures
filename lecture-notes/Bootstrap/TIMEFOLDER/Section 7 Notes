Bootstrap
---------

Bootstrap is a tool for developing responsive mobile first web projects. I.E. Make great looking sites quickly.

Bootstrap, if used well, makes it hard to tell that someone was using bootstrap. 

Bootstrap comes with preset styles in the included css files, but the styles can be overwritten by writing your own styles targeting the classes bootstrap comes with.

Jumbotron - used to display key content on your site. Takes up large amounts of space. Jumbotron will take up 100% width of whatever it is contained in unless styled otherwise. (div class="container")

Forms - take various types of information. Can be styled in a billion different ways. Important classes are form-group, form-inline, and form-control. Form-group provides proper spacing of the various form elements. Form-control essentially "bootstrapifies" the various elements inside the form. Wrapping a form inside a tag with form-inline will be forced in-line. 

Containers - a nice way to quickly get quality spacing of elements on the page.
