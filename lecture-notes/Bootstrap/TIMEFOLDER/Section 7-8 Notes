Bootstrap
---------

Bootstrap is a tool for developing responsive mobile first web projects. I.E. Make great looking sites quickly.

Bootstrap, if used well, makes it hard to tell that someone was using bootstrap. 

Bootstrap comes with preset styles in the included css files, but the styles can be overwritten by writing your own styles targeting the classes bootstrap comes with.

Jumbotron - used to display key content on your site. Takes up large amounts of space. Jumbotron will take up 100% width of whatever it is contained in unless styled otherwise. (div class="container")

Forms - take various types of information. Can be styled in a billion different ways. Important classes are form-group, form-inline, and form-control. Form-group provides proper spacing of the various form elements. Form-control essentially "bootstrapifies" the various elements inside the form. Wrapping a form inside a tag with form-inline will be forced in-line. 

Containers - a nice way to quickly get quality spacing of elements on the page.

Navbars - default styling for navigation bar elements. Requires jquery and bootstrap js in order for anything to actually work. Important class is (class="collapse navbar-collapse"). Anything inside the navbar with that class applied either directly or inherited will collapse automatically once mobile size has been reached on screen.
The hamburger button is applied with 3 spans being styled into bars inside of a button. The key thing about the button is the data-target selector. Whatever id is in the data-target selector will be hidden and shown upon clicking the button. The # is not needed on subsequent ids, you need only match the exact spelling and syntax.


Grid System - The main reason people use bootstrap. Allows for easy layouts of the entire site that is mobile friendly. 12 is the key # here, every container can be divided into 12 units, and they can be nested within each other to further divide those units.

Bootstrap 4 specifics -

Flexbox - new system of positioning elements that eliminates messier tools of the past such as float.

5 sizings for columns - xs,sm,md,lg,xl

All available changes are in the boostrap docs online.

Bootstrap 4 Typography
----------------------

Display - resizes various elements (h1 in the video) and gives them more prominence on the page.

Blockquotes - now uses a class to style text into a block quote <blockquote class="blockquote"></blockquote>

Cite is now used instead of a footer that was used in bootstrap 3.

To reverse the block quote just add text-right to the class.

rem - root em (pronounced m) replaces pixel for sizing. Default root size is 16px for google. rem is a multiplier so should the root font size change, the text will adjust in scale automatically. Not as rigid as px.

Utilties
--------

Border - a class that auto adds a border to an element. A border can be subjtracted in case you have a border applied from your own styling using border-0. You can remove specific sides of the border however a full border must be there by default in order for this to work. Color can be changed in the same manner as text via the default text color classes. You can add easy round edges and even have a circle border using border-rounded.

Spacing - contains classes for both margin and padding. p or m is used for padding and margin respectively. You can then add a letter (t,l,r,b,x,y) for what sides you want the spacing applied to. 0 - 5 are used to determine the amount of spacing or padding being applied to the element. All spacing is based off of rems as well. Breakpoints can be adjusted using either p or m to target what you are trying to change, then the sides you want the style on, then the size of the screen you want the change to be applied to. The screen size will set the amouunt of either p or m you want to change at that size and up.
