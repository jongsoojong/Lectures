You will remake the example png in a html file with all the boilerplate and correct things

Notes:

I named the title as the tags so you wont get confused. Use them as a reference for the title tag without the reference.

Also note the title of the page; dont forget that

Use any image from google images. right-click and copy image address.

make sure the link on the bottom actually goes to google.
