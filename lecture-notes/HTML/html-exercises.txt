What we will do for the first day.

We will solely focus on HTML 

Last Exercise of the day will be time recreating a document I made.

OBJECTIVES

Write simple HTML documents.
Understand the difference between closing and self closing tags
write tags with attributes
Use MDN as a reference
Given an image, write the corresponding HTML

Tags: Usually has opening and closing tags, closing tags have a slash.

Read this and use it as a reference : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML



Notes:

Learn to create to boilerplate for html

The doctype just states that you are using HTML.

html element is the root element, everything must me inside (it will always have one head and one body)

Head provides general information, metadata and its titles and links to scripts and style sheets

Body has all the contents of an html document.


HEADINGS

Headings are block elements (they get their own lines, Opposed to inlines)

P Tags
Paragraph tags (also block level, this is how you separate large chunks of texts).


Inline tags

Such as strong which bolds texts (doesn't force elements to a new line.)

em tag, emphasis which italizes tags.

LISTS

Lists of its own doesnt do anything (needs items in the list.) (can change to roman numerals with css)

We can also nest lists inside lists (fucking inception dawg).




Stuff to do:

Teach how to comment

<!-- --> (also show how to command slash)

title tag actually shows the thing that shows up when google searches.

Show him new tags

Do Exercise.








Exercise 1:

Remake the following 






Divs:

Generic container for elements

Groups things togther


Span:

Also a generic container

But its not a block level. So if you want to style just a part of p or stuff use span.
