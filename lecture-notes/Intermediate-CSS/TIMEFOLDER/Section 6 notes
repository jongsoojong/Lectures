Text and Fonts

No guaranteed way of knowing full list of fonts available as they differ from machine to machine.

Some fonts are almost universal and are more commonly chosen in order to maximize compatibility.

Fonts that have #'s in front of the name are not valid css lines on their own and must be put in "" i.e. 19 Arial is "19 Arial"

Font-family - grouping of similar fonts 

Font-size - literall the size of the text as it appears on screen. Can be used in both hard and relative terms. 
	PX is a hard value and will be displayed as such unless overruled by something more specific. 25px = 25 pixels no matter what screen. 

	EM is relative to the font size of the parent element. If no font size was set then it becomes the browser default value. (Chrome = 16px so 1em would = 16px)


Font-weight - how thick the lines are / how heavy the text appears on screen.
