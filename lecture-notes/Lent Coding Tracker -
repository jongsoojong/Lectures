Lent Coding Tracker -

Hour 1: Today I spent the first hour going over the last lesson in the css selectors section. I reviewd the solution video to the exercise and corrected the mistaks I had (only 2). Then I continued into the Intermediate CSS section which kicked off with Text and Fonts.

Hour 2: I finished up with font weight and various other manipulations of text and moved into positioning. After the lesson I attempted the tic tac toe challenge solo at first. I was unable to get the horizontal lines to show up at first but when I watched the solution video I was pleased to see I was not far off and only made a mistake by not remembering something I learned earlier in the lessons.
