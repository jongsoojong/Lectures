Lent Coding Tracker -

Hour 1: Today I spent the first hour going over the last lesson in the css selectors section. I reviewd the solution video to the exercise and corrected the mistaks I had (only 2). Then I continued into the Intermediate CSS section which kicked off with Text and Fonts.

Hour 2: I finished up with font weight and various other manipulations of text and moved into positioning. After the lesson I attempted the tic tac toe challenge solo at first. I was unable to get the horizontal lines to show up at first but when I watched the solution video I was pleased to see I was not far off and only made a mistake by not remembering something I learned earlier in the lessons.


Hour 3: I created the basic image gallery and blog sites. This utilized properites of the box model as well as proper spacing and even some researh of elements previously undiscussed.

Hour 4: Began lessons on bootstrap. Learned about default classes included with bootstrap and how to include a bootstrap framework into your file.

Hour 5: Totally forgot to do today's hour. Going to code for 2 tomorrow to make it up.

Hour 6: Should really start calling these days lol. Did 2 hours today to make up for forgetting yesterday. Made an image gallery with bootstrap utilizing the grid system. Made nav bar changes and linked to font awesome for custom icons.
