Selectors simply state which html element you are going to apply the CSS to.

Element selctors will select every instance of a given element 

I.E. div {
	background: black;
}
 - this will select all div elements within the body tag and set their background to the color black.

 ID - selects a single element with the corresponding ID attribute you have given the html element. Each ID is unique and can only appear 1 time per page

  I.E. #(insert ID name here){
blah: blah;
  }

  Class - just like ID but used for groups of elements you want to change at the same time. Can appear multiple times per page.

  I.E. .(insert class name here){
   blah: blah;
  }

  Inheritance - If a element is styled and no specific styling is stated for elements nested within, all nested elements receive the CSS of the parent element that was selected. 

  Specific trumps general. The more specific the more priority.

  Type seletors are least specific, id selectors are most specific
  I.E type<class<id
